# Bug-tracker

This bug tracker web application has a React.js front end and a Node.js backend using express (code is in the node-backend folder). In order to run it, download the npm installer and then run npm install to download the dependencies. 

To run the back end, type npm run dev into terminal. Then run the front end through typing npm start. The front end will be running on port 3000 while making calls to port 3002 where the back end is running.
